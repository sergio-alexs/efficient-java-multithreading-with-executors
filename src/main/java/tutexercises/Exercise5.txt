OBSERVATIONS AND INFERENCES (Exercises 1-4)
=============================================

1. Fixed Thread Pool (Exercise 1 & 3):
   - As the number of threads in the pool increases, the total execution time generally decreases initially.
   - This is because more tasks can be processed concurrently, utilizing the available CPU cores more effectively.
   - However, after a certain point (often related to the number of CPU cores), increasing the number of threads further does not significantly improve performance and may even degrade it.
   - This degradation is due to the overhead of context switching between threads. When there are more threads than cores, the OS has to constantly switch between them, which consumes resources.
   - With a larger load (5000 tasks vs 1000 tasks), the trends remain similar, but the total time increases proportionally.

2. Cached Thread Pool (Exercise 2 & 4):
   - The cached thread pool creates new threads as needed if no existing threads are available.
   - For a large number of short-lived tasks or tasks submitted in a burst, this can lead to a very high number of threads being created (potentially thousands).
   - While this might seem to offer maximum concurrency, the overhead of creating and managing so many threads can be substantial.
   - In some cases, the cached thread pool might perform worse than a well-tuned fixed thread pool because of this overhead and excessive context switching.
   - It also risks running out of memory if too many threads are created.

3. Throughput vs. Latency:
   - Tuning the thread pool size is a trade-off.
   - Too few threads: CPU underutilization, lower throughput.
   - Too many threads: Excessive context switching, overhead, potentially lower throughput and higher latency per task.
   - The "sweet spot" depends on the nature of the tasks (CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound) and the hardware (number of cores).
   - For CPU-bound tasks (like CalculationTaskC), a pool size close to the number of cores (or slightly higher) is usually optimal.

4. General Inference:
   - There is no "one size fits all" for thread pool configuration.
   - It requires experimentation and tuning based on the specific workload and hardware.
   - Monitoring tools and metrics (like execution time, thread count) are essential for this tuning process.
